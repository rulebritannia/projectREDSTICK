				<p>Many media companies claim that by refusing to let so called refugees into our countries, we are being "toxic" and "islamaphobic."  The truth is, many of the anti-western sentiments people from these nations hold have the potential to hurt the US in the long run.  Blind acceptance of Islam is naivety.</p>

				<h1>"1 in 8 Muslims world wide hold a favorable view of al Qaeda."</h1>
                <p>While many claim that it is incorrect to generalize Muslims based on the actions of a few individuals, the simple fact is that many people in the Islamic world hold positive opinions about terrorism.  One in eight Muslims world wide hold a favorable view of al Qaeda [1].  For other groups, like Hamas, this rate rises to one in three [1].  After Osama Bin Laden was eliminated, the majority of Pakistanis grieved over his death [2].  After the Charlie Hebdo murders, one in five Turks believed that the cartoonists "got what they deserved" for insulting Islam [3].</p>

			<h1>1 in 10 Muslims believe that Sharia law must be imposed worldwide through Jihad</h1>
			<p>Many Muslims wish to impose their ideas of law in order over top of the west.  One third of all Muslims in America believe that Sharia law is greater than the Constitution [5].  In the US, almost 1 in 10 Muslims believe that Sharia law must be imposed worldwide through Jihad [5].  While the excuse is constantly made that Jihad is simply "self betterment," one in four Muslims living in the US believe that violence against Americans is acceptable as part of Jihad [6].</p>

            <h1>90% of Middle Eastern immigrants do not pay income tax</h1>
            <p>Settling these people into the US is a costly affair.  Re-settling one Middle Eastern refugee in America costs nearly $64,370 over five years [7].  91.4% of these people claim food-stamps every year [7].  To make matters worse, nearly 90% of Middle Eastern immigrants do not pay income tax [7].</p>
