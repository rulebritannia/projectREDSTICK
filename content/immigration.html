                <p>Ignoring the issues that immigration from South and Central America is a costly and fatal mistake.  We must take swift action against the problems these groups bring to our nation.  Failure to do so could aggravate an already out of control situation.</p>

				<h1>Hispanics are 19 times more likely to be in a gang.</h1>
				<p>Many people claim that the very idea of immigrants committing felonies is racist.  However Hispanics are imprisoned at a rate 2.9 times that of White people [1] while receiving shorter prison sentences for the same crimes [2].  This problem doesn’t go away with time either, the children of Hispanic immigrants have a higher crime rate than the immigrants themselves [1].  Hispanics are three times as likely as Whites to commit violent crime, and 19 times more likely to be in a gang [3].</p>

				<h1>"Nearly half of all Hispanic children are born out of wedlock."</h1>
				<p>The families that these immigrants bring are often broken and detriment the community around them.  Nearly half of all Hispanic children are born out of wedlock [4].  The children of these families pursue and earn college degrees at extremely low rates; rates that haven’t changed in nearly two decades [4].  These demographic changes are so dramatic, that in states like California, the per capita incomes of family households are project to drop by a huge margin [4].</p>
