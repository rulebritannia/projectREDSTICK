				<p>GENDER</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>"Gender". "Sex." Two words that were synonymous prior a certain "sexologist" - a Dr. John Money, who decided that there was in fact a difference between "sex", which was determined physical and biological attributes, and "gender" - which he described as your "mental" or perceived gender. This is of course grossly false, and is a very damaging notion for both individuals and society, as is demonstrated in one of his own studies - but more on him later. <br/> In the modern day, there are plenty of celebrities and self-professed "science guys" - looking at you Bill Nye - who will tell you that gender is one's self-identity, and is on a spectrum. This is of course not actually backed up by any scientific studies, except for asking confused people if they thought they were born with the the wrong body parts. Proponents of such an unfounded world-view are willing to sink to any depths of depravity in order to validate their feelings.</p>

				<h1>The John/Joan Case</h1>
				<p>Back to John Money. Let's take the foundational experiment from which the concept of gender as separate from sex was built. After one of 2 twins - born Bruce and Brian Reimer - was accidentally castrated following a botched circumcision, Dr. John Money, in an attempt to prove his unfounded claim that gender was based solely on nurture - not nature - convinced the parents to have him given reassignment surgery - Bruce was now Brenda, and was raised as such. Despite "Brenda"'s ignorance of his true identity, he was an awfully unhappy child who resisted every step of the way. Eventually, "Brenda" learned the truth, and immediately renamed himself David and began living as a male. Per David's memoirs, we know that Dr. Money, frustrated with the lack of success in David's reprogramming to female identification, often forced David and his twin brother to simulate sex acts on one another, took nude photos of them, frequently performed "genital inspections" and other forms of abuse. Brian Reimer died of a drug overdose in 2002, traumatised by Dr Money's abuse. David Reimer shot himself with a sawnoff shotgun 2 years later. <br/> At the time, Dr. Money had written glowing reports about how the experiment had been a resounding success, solidifying the idea that gender is a social construct, propelling this idea into the mainstream, even publishing a 1969 book named "Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment", which was widely celebrated by the ever growing pseudo-science progressive community. This is easily provable using Google's Ngram Viewer: the usage of the word "gender" from 1960 - when it was virtually non-existent - to 2000 increased by over 5,000%.<br/>The details of Dr. Money's heinous crimes were not revealed until decades later, but the damage had been done. Dr John Money died aged 84, having enjoyed a successful career as a psychologist/"sexologist" with some 2000 published books, articles and academic journals attributed to him.<br/>Unsurprisingly, he was also a <span style="color:#BF584E;font-weight:bold;">strong advocate for PEDOPHILIA.</span> In one article he writes:<br/>"If I were to see the case of a boy aged <span style="color:#BF584E;font-weight:bold;">ten or eleven</span> who's intensely erotically attracted toward a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally mutual, and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual ... then I would not call it pathological in any way."<br/><span style="color:#BF584E;font-weight:bold;">John Money was a sadistic pedophile and whatever justice he did not receive in this world we can only pray is delivered in the next.</p>

				<h1>Long term impacts</h1>
				<p>Now, schools are beginning to tell children that gender is not real, trying to tell us that they can make a decision that affects the rest of their lives before they are the age of ten. The surgical and pharmaceutical measures taken to reassign one's gender are invasive, irreversible, and imperfect. Post-op "Transexuals" have a higher suicide rate than their pre-op counterparts. Now, parents will ask their children if they are the other Sex, and children, ever eager to please, will say yes because they do not comprehend the brevity of the consequences.</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>Do you want to risk the wellbeing of your children to uphold the work of a child molester who sought fame? Do you wish to irrevocably harm your child psychologically, simply for the chance to virtue signal?  There are only 2 Genders. We should treat the mentally ill, not enable them in ways that trickle down into harming our children.</p>
