				<h2>Congratulations</h2>
				<p>You are now the proud owner of a Flash Drive. But what now?</p>
				<p>Some would call this stick an archive of data. Some would call it a free flash drive. Others would call it the peaceful rebellion of a populace tired of being manipulated. <br></br> What you've found is the collaboration of those who feel the hard truth has become too ugly for it to be attached to one's public identity. </p>
				<p>The person who dropped it is most likely a working class individual, perhaps not unlike yourself. You may wonder to what ideology, religion, cult, or, worse yet, product this flash drive is recruiting for. This flash drive is <span class="red">not intended to be an ideological advertisement</span>, though it may have that effect. </p>
				<p>The goal of this collection of pictures and documents is to highlight the existence (and needless to say the cause) of the increasing <span class="red">degeneration</span>, <span class="red">unhappiness</span>, and <span class="red">injustice</span> in our society.</p>
				<p>These are not issues to be taken lightly, and a purely objective standpoint will be observed throughout. We ask that you forget all current conceptions of the world you may hold, including any political ideology you assign yourself to, and enter with an entirely open mind.</p>
				<p>If you are a <span class="red">high school student</span>, this stick is about the indoctrination in your increasingly standardized curriculum.</p>
				<p>If you are a <span class="red">teenage girl</span>, this stick is about the society that encourages you to throw away your innocence to men that want to use you as that weekend's meat wallet.</p>
				<p>If you are a <span class="red">university student</span>, this stick is about the neon haired harpies that you saw protesting the other week, who alternate between aggressor and victim as they please.</p>
				<p>If you are a <span class="red">working man</span>, this stick is about the ball and chain that is your perpetual debt.</p>
				<p>If you are a <span class="red">working woman</span>, this stick is about the legitimacy of your desires for a table full of smiling children with your respectable husband.</p>
