				<p>If you are content with the ways things are; if you don't like hearing things that challenge your worldview; if you want to remain ignorant to reality that surrounds you: stop. Put the Flash Drive back where you found it, move on, and we'll pray for humanity that not everyone is as cowardly as you.</p>
				<p>But if you see this as legitimate; if you are willing to consider the possibility that we are in fact reaching out </p>
				<p><span style="font-size:130%;">to <span class="red" style="font-weight:bold;">you</span></span></p>
				<p>then read on.</p>
				<p>This will be an enlightening experience, and one that will allow you to view the world in a different light.</p>
				<p>As for us, we will continue to resist those who seek to control us and brainwash our families and friends. Opening the minds of humanity is a necessary first step.</p>
				<p>Help us with this step, friend. </p>
